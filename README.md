# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

 ## Run Locally

Install dependencies

```bash
  yarn install && pod install && cd ../
```

Start the server

```bash
  yarn run start
```

Start your _Android_ or _IOS_ app

_Android_:
```bash
  yarn android
```

_IOS_:
```bash
  yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
